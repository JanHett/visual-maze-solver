# Visual Maze Solver

Solves mazes using image processing techniques. This program expects its input
to be images of mazes with the following properties:

- corridors are pure white and have an odd width
- width and height of corridors are equal
- walls are pure black and 1 px wide
- the entire maze is surrounded by a wall
- there is exactly one "entrance"/beginning and it is defined to be in the top left corner
- there is exactly one "exit"/end and it is defined to be in the bottom right corner

It produces images that have the solution drawn in as a red line.

# Compilation and usage

This code requires `libvips` to be installed on the system. It can be compiled and run as follows:

```sh
clang++ src/main.cpp -o visual-maze-solver --std=c++20 -Wall -O3 `pkg-config vips-cpp --cflags --libs`
# read `blank_maze.png` and write the solution to `solved.png`
./visual-maze-solver blank_maze.png solved.png
```
